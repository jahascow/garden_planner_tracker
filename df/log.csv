"
6,2,Amendments,5/30/2025,Wicking bucket,3,None,"added blood meal to the tomatoes in the wicking buckets as they do have fruit but their foilage is lighter green and less than in ground plants.  Seeing if the added nitrogen will help

"
19,25,Direct sow,2025/01/29,Main Garden,2,None,"Planted with propgated onion starts from store grocery onions.
These did not survive where planted, I think they need to be planted when the temperatures are warmer.  Since wicking bucket works may just recommend using those going forward and save the space.

23,27,Direct Sow,2025/02/02,Raised Bed,6,None,"planted in raised bed made primarily of organic compost. These where store bought organic russets that had sprouted.

"
24,28,Direct sow,2025/01/22,Raised bed,30,None,"These are costco garlic that was soaked in hydrogen peroxide first.  Next time I think I should also set in fridge for a week or so.  Need to fill in if these are hardneck or softneck when identified.  First 3 garlic plants surfaced on the 14th day as noted

"
25,29,Direct sow,2025/02/05,Main Garden,69,None,"Used a bamboo stick to set holes to drop onion starts in which saved my back and a lot of time, highly recommend repeating upon success :). The onions where paired with tomatoes as well as some being the only plants as dividers between larger plants to fully utilize spacing as noted in the 2025 Spring Garden planting map.

Many did not make it, believe they did not get enough watering & that more compost would have helped in mounding these.

acutal quantity unknown but theorized based on production visibility in june that we had two that went to main garden and three in container buckets
