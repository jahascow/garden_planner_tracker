19,25,Direct sow,2025/01/29,Main Garden,2.0,,"Planted with propgated onion starts from store grocery onions.
These did not survive where planted, I think they need to be planted when the temperatures are warmer.  Since wicking bucket works may just recommend using those going forward and save the space.

The onions where paired with tomatoes as well as some being the only plants as dividers between larger plants to fully utilize spacing as noted in the 2025 Spring Garden planting map.

Many did not make it, believe they did not get enough watering & that more compost would have helped in mounding these.
